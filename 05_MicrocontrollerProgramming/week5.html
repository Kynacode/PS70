#### Week 3: Microcontroller Programming 



This week was an introduction to microcontroller programming.



I decided to build off my previous assignment, which was the Marching Machine project. My goal for this project was to program my Marching Machine to move for a certain amount of time and reverse as well.

I had to first learn how to us an Arduino board in order to be able to program it. I was able to quickly learn how to program it with the help of the website listed below.


<li>Arduino Projects Book (here)
<li>Arduino Tutorial 1 (here )
<li>Microcontroller Programming (here)


 I thought it would be a good idea to sketch out the circuit on my iPad because I wasn't sure where to begin. I originally intended to complete my project with just an Arduino and a motor, but I felt that would be boring. So, to add some pizzazz, I added an LED and other nice components to my circuit to get more practice utilizing them.

This was my first time using different elements to program a motor to run by itself. By drawing the circuit, I was able to see what material I would need to program my marching machine. I felt more confident that I could make it work!


The material I use included:

Arduino board
Led 
1 100hz Resistor
Micro Sero
L9110
Motor 
Cable cords


I decided to build a circuit using a Led, Micro Sero, and L9110 in order to make my marching machine more interesting. I uploaded the code for utilizing Multi-tasking for Arduino by following the instructions on this page. Additionally, I developed a class in my code for the motor and utilized an if/else statement to control how long it marches in one direction and when to change directions in order to accomplish my aim of making it more fourth for a predetermined length of time.


Here is my code down below.
