#### Week 4:3D Design, Printing, Scanning


Objectives:Design and print a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods.

            Scan something using a photogrammetry, LIDAR, or other application.

            Update your website with more information about your final project.           

 Week 4 was all about 3D Design, Printing and Scanning.

 Last week, I discovered that I would need to cut out several components from cardboard using the laser cutter in order to assemble a shoe.So this week I decided to 3D print the shoes. 3D printing gives me the ability to print the whole shape of the shoe, including the spats. Later, I'll explain what a spat is to you. My week 4 project's theme is therefore the same as last week's, "Matching to the tone."

###Shape 

The inspiration for the shape of the shoe came from my old band shoes. My band shoes were black and sharp with a smooth polished finish. We also had to wear vinyl snap spats. At first I did not like the spat because I thought it looked funny, but over time it grew on me. Below are examples of all-black band shoes on the left and on the right with spats.

For the sides of the box I drew out a sketch on a piece of paper(down below), and cut it out on cardboard.
