#### Week 4:3D Design, Printing, Scanning


Objectives:Design and print a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods.

            Scan something using a photogrammetry, LIDAR, or other application.
             
            Update your website with more information about your final project.           

The theme of my week 3 project is “Matching to the tone”. When I was younger, I was in a marching band. I used to march and play music for hours in parades and had so much fun doing it. I thought it would be cool to make something that reminds me of those days. So, I decided to make something that would mimic the movement of someone marching.

I decided to work from the bottom up, starting with my base. I wasn't sure how big I wanted it at first. I measured some cardboard in class to get an idea of what it might look like. I created a 100 by 100 square in Fusion360. After creating that file as a DXF, I print it out on the laser cutter. After printing it out, super glue all the parts together. You can see the final results in the image down below.

For the sides of the box I drew out a sketch on a piece of paper(down below), and cut it out on cardboard.
