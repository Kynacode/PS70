#### Week 2:2D Design and Cutting 

This last week, I learned about cutting and 2D design. I used vinyl cutting, laser cutting, and computer-aided design software called Fusion 360. Since it was my first time using Fusion 360, I must admit that I initially felt a little overwhelmed by all of its many features. However, I was able to adjust fast. The major task for this week was to create press-fit cardboard object using laser cutting; however, adhesive was strictly prohibited.

So I choose to create a simple yet distinctive design with Fusion 360. I began with a square, to which I added three additional, 2.0 mm wide, vertical rectangles. After creating my drawing in Fusion360, I exported it as a DXF file, sent it to the laser cutter, and then extruded it into 3D using 2D projection. The only issue I encountered when using the laser cutter to cut it out was that my vertical rectangle wasn't wide enough to allow it to move up and down. To fix this problem I expand my vertical rectangle to 2.2mm and it came out perfect.

I also use vinyl cutting. A vinyl cutter is an easy-to-use device that can create banners, stickers, and even signs. To use the vinyl cutter, I just had to make a grayscale or black & white PNG bitmap image. I decided to create a png bitmap of a Jordan sign. I download my file or image from here, save it to a hard drive, and then open it in the desktop computer to which the vinyl cutter was attached. I just modified the scale after that, pushed calculate, and it printed.
