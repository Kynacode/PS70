#### Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture 



Objectives: Create a kinetic sculpture. 
            Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
            Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.

The theme of my week 3 project is “Matching to the tone”. When I was younger, I was in a marching band. I used to march and play music for hours in parades and had so much fun doing it. I thought it would be cool to make something that reminds me of those days. So, I decided to make something that would mimic the movement of someone marching.
