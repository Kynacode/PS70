#### Week 1: Project porpoal 
Final Project Idea

My goal for my final project is to create or improve a medical device that can enhance people's daily life.


Idea 1: Assistive robotic machine 

My main goal is to make daily life better for others, and exoskeleton technology can help me with that. By wearing an exoskeleton suit, which may also protect other body parts from injury, people can decrease the wear and tear of continual stretching and lifting. It can also be used to help someone recover after an injury that has caused them to lose strength or range of motion.

Idea 2: Digital Shoe sizer 

I have a passion for sneakers and take pleasure in assisting others in selecting the best pair for their personal style. The biggest problem is that the majority of individuals are unaware of their proper shoe size. By developing a digital shoe sizer, I want to solve this issue. With the use of the digital shoe sizer, someone might determine their proper shoe size by standing on it like a scale.
